This application defines three microservices, ```/service1```, /service2, and /service3, which are implemented as Flask routes. 

```/service1``` and ```/service2``` both make HTTP requests to the other services using the ```requests``` library. When you access ```/service1```, it will make a request to ```/service2```, which in turn will make a request to ```/service3```. 

The final response will be the concatenation of the responses from all three services.

To run this application, you will need to have ```Flask``` and the ```requests``` library installed. 

You can install these dependencies using pip install flask requests. Then, you can run the application using 

> ```python app.py```

This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the microservices at 

http://localhost:8000/service1, 
http://localhost:8000/service2, and 
http://localhost:8000/service3.
